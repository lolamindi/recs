## Overview

### Requirements

You will need to develop a PHP web application connected to a MySQL database. Your project should have a well-organised file structure, be designed with a monolithic MVC architecture, and developed with object-oriented programming (OOP). 

#### Functional Requirements:
- The application MUST display all the books in the database to be viewed by all users
- The application MUST allow all users search for a book by title or author
- The application MUST show detailed information about each book on a different page

- The application MUST have a login/logout feature for the admin user
- The admin user of the application MUST be able to add a book
- The admin user of the application MUST be able to edit the information of each book
- The admin user of the application MUST be able to delete each book

#### Non-Functional Requirements (Quality Attributes)

### Testing

This project includes unit testing in PHPUnit to ensure the reliability and functionality of the BooksController class, which interacts with the booksModel class. The tests focus on checking that various functions exist and work correctly. All tests passed. Here is an overview of the tests and their purposes:

#### Method Existence Tests:
- *testThatThereIsAGetBooksFunction()* ---> Verifies that the getBooks method exists in the BooksController class

- *testThatThereIsASearchBooksFunction()* ---> Ensures the searchBooks method is present

- *testThatThereIsADeleteBookFunction()* ---> Checks for the existence of the deleteBook method

- *testThatThereIsAnAddBookFunction()* ---> Confirms the presence of the addBook method

- *testThatThereIsAnEditBookFunction()* ---> Validates the existence of the editBook method

#### Functionality Tests:

- *testSearchBooksFunctionality()*
  - Mocks the searchBooks method of booksModel to check that it returns the correct results for a given keyword
  - Asserts that the results are not empty and matches with the expected output

- *testAddBookFunctionality()*
  - Mocks the addBook method of booksModel to check that it is called with the correct parameters
  - Confirms that the method adds the book as expected

- *testEditBookFunctionality()*
  - Mocks the editBook method of booksModel to check that it is called with the correct parameters
  - Confirms that the method edits the book as expected

- *testDeleteBookFunctionality()*
  - Mocks the deleteBook method of booksModel to check that it is called with the correct parameters
  - Confirms that the method deletes the book as expected
